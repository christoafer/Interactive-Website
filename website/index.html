  According to Psychology Today,

    <blockquote> It is proven that some people, to escape the problems in their life, play video games because
       they are focused on the need for power and status. Video game addiction is caused by people who
       experience real-life failure and escape that by feeling powerful and accomplished through playing video
      games.

  You may ask how this is possible. Well, here are
Tech Addiction's top reasons on why video games are so addicting:
</p>

<!-- <blockquote> “The most addictive video games have no pre-defined ends”, causing the player to want to play
   more because the brain never experiences the “Game Over” feeling.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“Video games are more addictive when in-game rewards are based on a leveling system.” These games usually
reward the player by giving their avatar higher rated attributes, which gives the sense of reward to the
 player, cause them to play more.
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
“Addictive video games often have some form of in-game currency.” A reason for video game addiction is
 because the in-game currency is a virtual representation of what humans strive for in the real world,
 which is money. This causes the user to be so locked up in acquiring virtual in-game currency they become
 addicted to the game.

<blockquote>
“It is easier to view video games as harmless online activities.” Many people view video games as a
harmless pastime compared to alcohol and drugs. However, since it seems like a harmless hobby, it is harder
 for people to recognize when they’re addicted.
</blockquote>





<blockquote>
“One important factor that makes video games addictive is that rewards often are set on variable schedules.”
Video games can be addictive because of the variable rewarding systems. A certain number of tasks or points
 must be reached before the player is rewarded. However, the player doesn’t know when the requirements for
 the reward is fulfilled, causing them to play until they’ve received the reward.
</blockquote>




<blockquote>
“Addictive video games often require team play to advance.” Because of the team play requirements in some
games, the player feels obligated to help out his/her teammates. This relationship creates an interpersonal
connection, which is what all humans need, but because it is an online connection, the player may lose touch
with the interpersonal connections they have in the real world.
</blockquote>




<blockquote>
“The virtual world of addictive video games continues to evolve even if the player is not online.” The
virtual world of video games develop and change, no matter if the player plays the game or not. To not feel
 left behind, players will play more in an effort to not “miss” the updates.
